# C++ OpenGL Raytracer
OpenGL Raytracer using Compute Shaders  
  
# Install instructions  
Follow the instructions at https://github.com/williamsandst/opengl-boilerplate (but remember the repo has a different name!)
  
# Todo 
Ray bouncing (reflections, refraction etc)  
Triangle intersection (for polygonal models later on)  
Implement objects as a texture, which allows dynamic object creation instead of the current hardcoded objects in the shader
